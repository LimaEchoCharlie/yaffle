This is a small demo application to test the [Rainbird](https://rainbird.ai/) automation platform. It attempts to deduce what language `Fred` speaks.

To run this application, you need a Rainbird API key. Set the environment variable `RB_API_KEY` to the value of your key:

```
export RB_API_KEY=1111aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333-cccc4444dddd
```

To run:
```
go run main.go
```
